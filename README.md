The platform is structured around three main components. One component handles external customers and suppliers, providing services for suppliers to submit bids related to their available stock. The remaining two components manage internal processes: one handles the client-side operations, and the other manages backend processes. These components are maintained separately to enhance system security and improve backend performance and scalability.

### Purpose

The main goal of this ERP system is to improve operational efficiency, ensure accurate data handling, and provide better visibility across the various departments of Wijesundara Rice Mill.

### What is an ERP System?

**ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)** is a type of software that helps organizations manage and integrate their core business processes in a centralized system. 

Instead of using separate systems for accounting, inventory, sales, HR, and production, an ERP combines all these functions into one unified platform, allowing for better coordination, real-time data sharing, improved efficiency, and easier decision-making.

In simple terms, ERP helps a business operate smoothly by connecting different departments and giving everyone access to the same up-to-date information.

### Features Included in Wijesundara ERP System

During the system development phase, we analyzed, categorized, and clustered the business requirements based on departmental operations and workflows. The following are the core modules integrated into the system, which are commonly found in standard ERP solutions:

- Inventory Management
- Order Processing
- Transportation Management
- Accounting & Finance
- Human Resource Management
- Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
- Supplier Chain Management

In addition to these standard modules, we developed several custom solutions to address the company’s unique operational challenges and optimize their workflow:

#### ✅ Stock Transportation Tracking

A key challenge the company faced was missing stock during transportation, with limited ability to identify where or how losses occurred.  
We developed a transportation tracking system that monitors stock withdrawals, movements, and deposits, while recording the responsible person, location, and vehicle assigned. This provides clear accountability for stock transfers.

#### ✅ Transportation Task Assignment

The company operates two types of transportation vehicles: owned and hired. When transportation services are needed, departments can submit transportation requests, specifying their requirements. The transportation management team can then assign tasks based on vehicle availability and operational status.

#### ✅ Stock State Management

In a rice mill, stock may exist in various processing states. The stock management system keeps track of available quantities across these different states, enabling better forecasting and decision-making for production and sales.

#### ✅ Supplier Bidding System

Traditionally, purchasing stock involved manual coordination with suppliers, negotiating prices, and verifying stock availability.  
The new system includes a supplier portal that allows suppliers to place bids directly through the platform, specifying rice types, pricing, and stock availability. This streamlines the procurement process and improves stock management efficiency.

These features and innovations together form the **Wijesundara Rice Mill ERP System**, delivering tailored solutions that address both standard ERP functionalities and specific business challenges.
